            [Intro]
            Always do it on my own, so, I gotta get through it
            And the only thing I know is to love what I'm doing
            Never give up, never slow 'til I finally prove it
            Never listen to the no's, I just wanna keep moving
            
            [Verse 1]
            Keep my head up when I act, head up, that's a fact
            Never looking back, I'ma keep myself on track
            Keep my head up, staying strong, always moving on
            Feel I don't belong, tell my thoughts to move along
            Push myself to be the best, die with no regrets
            Live with every breath, see my message start to spread
            And I have so many dreams then you hit your teens
            Life ain't really what it seems, try to find out what it means
            
            [Chorus]
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            Always do it on my own, so, I gotta get through it
            And the only thing I know is to love what I'm doing
            Never give up, never slow 'til I finally prove it
            Never listen to the no's, I just wanna keep moving
            Yeah, I put out all this art, it's my only medicine, yeah
            Everything I do, I'm just being genuine, yeah
            I'm sick of being screwed, feel my own adrenaline
            Yeah, I do just what I do and I hope you let me in, let me in, yeah
            
            [Drop]
            I'm grateful, oh, yeah, able, oh, yeah
            I'm stable, oh, yeah, no label, oh, yeah
            You know me, I have only a path
            I'm lonely, but, damn, I'm going to win, yeah
            
            [Verse 2]
            I don't want no fake love, I want the real stuff
            Everybody listen up 'cause I'll only say it once
            I'm gon' show you all the path if you want it bad
            I'm gon' show you where it's at
            Yeah, how you can get it back, yeah
            'Cause I ain't never done, I'll be number one
            Working hella hard until I get just what I want, yeah
            Rise just like the sun, yeah, fatal like a gun
            Shooters gonna shoot and I'm gon' shoot until I've won, yeah
            
            [Chorus]
            (Yeah, yeah, yeah)
            Always do it on my own, so, I gotta get through it
            And the only thing I know is to love what I'm doing
            Never give up, never slow 'til I finally prove it
            Never listen to the no's, I just wanna keep moving
            Yeah, I put out all this art, it's my only medicine, yeah
            Everything I do, I'm just being genuine, yeah
            I'm sick of being screwed, feel my own adrenaline
            Yeah, I do just what I do and I hope you let me in, let me in, yeah
            
            [Drop]
